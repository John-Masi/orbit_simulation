# orbit_simulation
Simulating different orbits using numerical integration(RK4) in c++ and drawing the orbits in python with matplot lib and numpy 

Next it is to bundle the files together so you can run it on your own system via just the main.py,
right now i run it through a python env on my system.

Also later will implement a better integrating system(RKF45) as right now i lose accuracy after 10-12 time steps, and will
add a option to have img of the earth on the 3d meshgrid or not as the img of the earth makes the plotting really slow.
